Welcome to the repository showcasing my MSc dissertation - "Feedback-Driven Architecture (FDA) for Learning Analytics in Higher Education." 

This project centers on a pioneering architecture that seamlessly integrates feedback analysis to enhance decision-making the higher education learning and teaching environment. The architecture, structured in three tiers, leverages robust data preparation techniques to transform narrative student feedback into actionable insights. A compelling case study validates the implementation's ability to provide impactful learning analytics, ultimately elevating the teaching and learning experience in higher education contexts.

The FDA underscores the fusion of text mining and NLP techniques to decipher narrative feedback. Utilizing Python, I executed intricate data analysis, spotlighting my prowess in programming and knack for translating cutting-edge technologies into tangible, real-world applications. Explore the repository to witness the synergy of education, technology, and practicality in this dynamic project.
